## ⭐ Key Insights
- **Females survived at a much higher rate** compared to males.  
- **1st class passengers** had the highest survival rate.  
- Many values in **Cabin** are missing, making it unreliable for modeling.  
- Age has some missing values but follows a reasonable distribution.  
- **Fare is positively correlated** with survival chances.

## 📥 How to Run
1. Open the notebook (`Task5_EDA.ipynb`) in Kaggle or Jupyter  
2. Make sure `train.csv` is in the same folder  
3. Run all cells to generate visualizations and insights

## 📝 Summary
This EDA project analyzes key factors affecting survival on the Titanic using Python visualization libraries and serves as part of my internship submission.
